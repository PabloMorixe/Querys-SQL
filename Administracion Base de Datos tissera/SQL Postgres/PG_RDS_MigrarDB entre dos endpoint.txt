Create the target DB instance
Create the target PostgreSQL DB instance using either the Amazon RDS console, AWS CLI, or API. Create the instance with the backup retention setting set to 0 and disable Multi-AZ. Doing so allows faster data import. You must create a database on the instance before you can dump the data. The database can have the same name as the database that is contained the dumped data. Alternatively, you can create a database with a different name. In this case, you use the pg_restore command and the -d parameter to restore the data into the newly named database.

For example, the following commands can be used to dump, restore, and rename a database.

pg_dump -Fc -v -h [endpoint of instance] -U [master username] [database] > [database].dump
createdb [new database name]
pg_restore -v -h [endpoint of instance] -U [master username] -d [new database name] [database].dump
